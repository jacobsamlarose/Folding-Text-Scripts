# Folding-Text-Scripts
Scripts to extend Folding Text 

Most of these are Applescript files with some hacky Javascript worked in where necessary. 
To install scripts, see here: http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/how-to-install-a-script/75
(TLDR: open Applescript editor, paste, run. I tend to use Fastscripts or TextExpander to call upon frequently used scripts, depending on whatever the most appropriate trigger is. 

# Tag Due Items With Today

This one evaluates your document for any node (item) tagged with @tomorrow and replaces @tomorrow with @today. It also keeps an eye out for @due tags, and if a due date matches today's date, it'll add a @today tag to that item. Useful to run first thing in the morning before getting down to work. Recommended trigger: Fastscripts.
